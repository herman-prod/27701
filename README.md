# ISO/IEC 27701 Knowledge Repository  
*A living collection of materials, research, and implementation resources for the ISO/IEC 27701 Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) framework.*

---

## 📘 About  
This repository serves as a **knowledge base and resource hub** for anyone working with, or studying, the **ISO/IEC 27701:2019** standard — the privacy extension to [ISO/IEC 27001](https://www.iso.org/isoiec-27001-information-security.html) and [ISO/IEC 27002](https://www.iso.org/standard/75652.html).  

It includes curated content, explanatory materials, and implementation aids that I continuously **upload, refine, and expand** over time. The goal is to make 27701 easier to understand, adopt, and integrate within existing Information Security Management Systems (ISMS).
